# Change log

## master

## 1.1.1 (2020-12-29)

- Fix Erlang Logger compatibility.

## 1.1.0 (2020-08-17)

- Drop Lager dependency.

Now standard Logger or `error_logger` (for OTP <21) is used instead.

[PR](https://github.com/palkan/influx_udp/pull/16).

## 1.0.0 (2019-01-06)

[Hex package](https://hex.pm/packages/influx_udp) is available ðŸŽ‰.

- Default pool behaviour changed.

Previously, the default configuration had both `influx_host` and `influx_port` defined, which made
the application start the _default_ pool connecting to `127.0.0.1:4444` (which didn't make a lot of sense, did it?).

We also had a special `{default_pool, false}` configuration variable to disable the default pool.

We removed the default value for `influx_host` (and changed the default `influx_port` to **8089**).

Now if `influx_host` is not defined, we do not start the default pool.
